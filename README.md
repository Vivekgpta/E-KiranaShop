# 🛒 E-Kirana Shop | Full-Stack E-Commerce Website

E-Kirana Shop is a **Blinkit-inspired e-commerce platform** built for my **personal shop in my village**.  
The project demonstrates my **full-stack development skills** with **React (frontend), Spring Boot (backend), and SQL (database)**.  

It enables local customers to browse products, add items to the cart, and place orders, while the shop admin can manage inventory and track orders.
